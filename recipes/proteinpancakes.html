        <h3>Protein pancake recipe</h3>

        <p>Pancakes that have loads of protein and yet taste great! 
            Serve with either 
            maple syrup or a spoonful of Greek yogurt with honey.</p>

        <h3>ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup whole wheat flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 cup low-fat cottage cheese</li>
        <li>¾ cup low-fat milk</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
    </ul> 

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Stir flour, baking soda, cinnamon, 
            and salt together in a large bowl.</li>

        <li>Whisk cottage cheese, milk, eggs, and oil together in a separate bowl. 
            Pour into the flour mixture; whisk until batter is just 
            combined; it will be thick.</li>

        <li>Heat an oiled griddle over medium-high heat; when a water 
            drop on the surface dances and sizzles, it's ready. 
            Drop 1/4 cup batter onto the griddle. 
            Cook until golden brown and bubbles break the surface, 
            1 to 2 minutes. Turn and cook until set, about 1 minute 
            more. 
            Repeat with remaining batter.</li>
