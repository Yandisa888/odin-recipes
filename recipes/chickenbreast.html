    <h3>Chicken breast recipe</h3>

    <p>This is a very easy, but elegant, baked chicken breast recipe that looks 
    like you've spent hours in the kitchen
     when you've barely lifted a finger!</p>

     <h3>ingredients</h3>

     <ul>
        <li>2 large bone-in chicken breast halves with skin</li>
        <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic, minced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
     </ul>

     <h3>Steps</h3>

     <ol>
        <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and garlic; 
        sprinkle with salt, black pepper, rosemary, and basil. 
        Arrange chicken in a large baking dish
        and refrigerate for at least 45 minutes.

        <li>Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 
            degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>

        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken meat is no longer pink at the bone
            and the juices run clear, 45 to 60 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest 
            part of the breast meat should read 
            165 degrees F (75 degrees C).</li>
    
    </ol>
